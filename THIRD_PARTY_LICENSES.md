# Third party licenses

`engine/dsat_7x6.js` and `engine/dsat_7x6.wasm` are compiled artifacts. They
contain code from the projects below, so their licenses travel with this
repository. Everything else here is MIT under `LICENSE`.

`engine/PROVENANCE.json` records the exact CaDiCaL commit and emscripten
version the shipped artifact was built from.

## CaDiCaL

The SAT solver, linked into the WebAssembly engine.

## Emscripten

The compiler and runtime. Its JavaScript support library is part of
`engine/dsat_7x6.js`, and its C and C++ standard library implementations are
linked into `engine/dsat_7x6.wasm`.

Emscripten is available under 2 licenses, the MIT license and the
University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.

Both are permissive open source licenses, with little if any
practical difference between them.

The reason for offering both is that (1) the MIT license is
well-known, while (2) the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source
License allows Emscripten's code to be integrated upstream into
LLVM, which uses that license, should the opportunity arise.

The full text of both licenses follows.

The musl libc project is bundled in this repo, and it has the MIT license, see
system/lib/libc/musl/COPYRIGHT

The third_party/ subdirectory contains code with other licenses. None of it is
used by default, but certain options use it (e.g., the optional closure compiler
flag will run closure compiler from third_party/).
